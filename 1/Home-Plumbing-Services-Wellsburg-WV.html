<p>The average life span of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, little pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
