<p>To set up plumbing service, call our Oakland plumbers day or night at (510) 939-7870 or submit the contact type. Plumbing by Jake has a tested record of 5-star service. We work with just the best water heater service technicians, we appear on time, and we make certain you get precisely what you need-- whether from your existing hot water heater or a new installation.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
