<p>Obvious smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or business area, offer us a call. That smell might be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be replaced rather than fixed. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or producing foul odors.</p>
