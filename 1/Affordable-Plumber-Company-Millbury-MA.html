<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Millbury MA?</h3>
<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of rust control. Thus, considering all these aspects, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
