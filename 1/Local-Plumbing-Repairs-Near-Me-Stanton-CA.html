<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Stanton CA</h3>
<p>In some cases called an auger, this convenient tool can clear blockages that might be stuck even more down the system. You'll have to disassemble the drain and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
