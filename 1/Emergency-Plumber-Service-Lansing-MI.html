Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
