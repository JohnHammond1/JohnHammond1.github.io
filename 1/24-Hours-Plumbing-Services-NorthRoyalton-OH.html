If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was built years prior to that, chances are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimal rates.</p>

Increased protection is also required when chemicals are added to a fire defense system supplied by a drinkable supply of water. Advise them to avoid hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have children. Holding on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home.
