Softening your water down to the optimum level of 6 grains of hardness is ideal for household usage due to the fact that the water stays less corrosive than over-softened water and is free of scale producing solidity. Since gas lines run from your home to the outdoor area of your residential or commercial property if there is a damaged gas line outside of the home you will see broken plants and condensation on the windows closest to the damaged plumbing.</p>
