<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
