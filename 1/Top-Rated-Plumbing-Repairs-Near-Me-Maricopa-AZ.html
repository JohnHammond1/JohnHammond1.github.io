<p>Inadequately installed gas lines cause gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling.

Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
