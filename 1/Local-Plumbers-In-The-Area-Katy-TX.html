<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
