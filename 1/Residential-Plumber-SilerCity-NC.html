<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

The typical warm water tank will last for 8-12 years so repairs or replacement is something that you must expect to handle a number of times.
