<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
