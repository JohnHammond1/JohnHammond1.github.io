Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
