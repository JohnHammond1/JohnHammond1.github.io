After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.
