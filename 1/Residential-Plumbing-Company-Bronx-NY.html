A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific residences, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>Fixing a leaky faucet appears like a simple task, but many times the situation can be deceptively made complex. Sometimes it's best to call in a certified plumber to make sure the root cause of the leak is appropriately identified and attended to the first time, instead of making numerous journeys to the hardware store and purchasing a variety of parts just to end up precisely where you began, or even worse, producing an even bigger mess. At South West Plumbing, our certified plumbers have the resources to identify the source of the leak and get it fixed for you. They can also examine your existing sinks and faucets to avoid future leakages.</p>
