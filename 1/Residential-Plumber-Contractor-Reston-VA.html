This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the typical direction.</p>

It can cause water to build all the way up your drains and create a leak someplace along the way if the P-trap under you sink is clogged.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
