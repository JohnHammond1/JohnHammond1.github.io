If your water heater isn't working, our skilled team of technicians at Kramer and Sons is prepared to supply you with top-notch, same-day service.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>It can quickly end up being a plumbing emergency for your home if a clogged drain is left untreated. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling we offer 24-hour emergency support for scenarios like burst pipes brought on by clogs. Disconnect the garbage disposal, if you're saving it. How the disposal is linked to the sink differs based upon brand and type. Refer to your product directions or contact the producer if you need guidance. The disposal will usually be linked to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
