<p>A minimum of when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps remove the sediment. If you find a leak and go with a patching task instead of a repiping task, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same material and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
