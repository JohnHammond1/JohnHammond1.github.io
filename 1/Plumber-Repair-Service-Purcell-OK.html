<p>Backflow preventers are vital for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The brine solution should be blended and stored in the brine tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, bacteria and fungi likewise form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, check out the producer's instructions prior to adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
