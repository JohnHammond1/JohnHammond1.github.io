<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is very important to understand the typical reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most commonly in the winter. This is because houses are not effectively aerated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to notify you of any possible gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you probably have corroded piping.</p>
