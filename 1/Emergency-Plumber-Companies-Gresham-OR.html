<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
