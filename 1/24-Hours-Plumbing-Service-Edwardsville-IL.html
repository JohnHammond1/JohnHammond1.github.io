<p>When picking the appropriate system protection there are numerous considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to fulfill that particular threat or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building.
