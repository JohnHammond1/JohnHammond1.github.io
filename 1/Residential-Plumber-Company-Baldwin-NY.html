<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
