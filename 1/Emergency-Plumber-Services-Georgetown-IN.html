<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical kind it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop should be higher than 33 feet to function properly. When created by doing this it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply. Plumb Crazy Plumbing offers a standard one month warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year service warranty on replacement plumbing jobs.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
