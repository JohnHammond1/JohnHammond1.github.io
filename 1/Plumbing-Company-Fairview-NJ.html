<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place.

This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
