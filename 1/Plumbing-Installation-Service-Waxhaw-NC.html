<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Waxhaw NC</h3>
<p>Sometimes called an auger, this helpful tool can clear blockages that may be stuck even more down the system. You'll need to take apart the drain and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe till you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
