<p>When selecting an insured and licensed plumbing contractor is just an easy phone call away, why risk an insurance coverage claim on a flooded house. Many people believe that store-bought drain cleaners will suffice. Though they might help sometimes, they have the potential to trigger more damage than great. For one, they might harm your pipes and on a bigger scale, these chemicals aren't environmentally friendly. It's best to trust the team at Wilson Plumbing & Heating to manage your issue securely and with care.</p>

<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. But finding the right washer might not be.
