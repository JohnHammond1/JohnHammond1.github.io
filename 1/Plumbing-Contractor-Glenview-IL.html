<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>Your company has been very useful to me for a long time. The young man who came a couple of days ago was so sincere with me.

That's a quality service. . Setting up a garbage disposal is a fairly simple job for an experienced do-it-yourselfer. Get a few standard tools and follow our how-to.</p>
