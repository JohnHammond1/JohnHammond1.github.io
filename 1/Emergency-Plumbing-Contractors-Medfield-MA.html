<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Medfield MA</h3>
<p>Throughout the years, product and particles collect in your drains. Most of these products wash away through the drain into your sewer line or septic tank. Nevertheless, some materials have a tendency to stick to the pipe wall and create a clog. Some of the most common factors to clogged drains consist of hair and skin flakes from the bath or shower, littles food, grease, oil and minerals such as magnesium and calcium that have sped up from the water. These products adhere to the side of the pipe wall and harden over time, producing a stubborn clog that is often tough to remove. Quality drain cleaning services can assist you return on track.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
