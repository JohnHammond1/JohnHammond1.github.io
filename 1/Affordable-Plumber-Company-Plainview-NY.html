<p>To repair and replace a gas line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually changing a gas line - if it's malfunctioning it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and products.

Additional gas line installation for brand-new home appliances are charged independently.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some problems will require total water heater replacement.
