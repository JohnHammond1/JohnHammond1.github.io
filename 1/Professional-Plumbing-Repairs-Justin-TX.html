<p>A lot of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
