<p>Water softeners are appliances connected to your home's water supply that get rid of the minerals like calcium and magnesium that cause water solidity. Water softening equipment can be easily removed, so you can take it with you if you move.

When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
