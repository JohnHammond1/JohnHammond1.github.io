<p>When selecting the proper system protection there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane garage will need a very various fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary considerably.</p>
