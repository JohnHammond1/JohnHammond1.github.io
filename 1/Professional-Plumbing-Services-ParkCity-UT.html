<p>Inadequately set up gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house."

At the least, it would have been a really costly choice.</p>
