<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance IslandPark NY</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their responsibilities break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who manage basic repairs (typically in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on renovating tasks and additions.</p>
<p>Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers complete an apprenticeship program and pass the required licensing exam to become journey-level workers. Journey-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are qualified to carry out tasks individually. Plumbers with a number of years of plumbing experience who pass another exam make master status. Some states require master plumber status in order to obtain a plumbing contractor's license.</p>
