Fire protection system are created to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to meet that specific threat or need. An airplane garage will need a really different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary considerably.</p>
