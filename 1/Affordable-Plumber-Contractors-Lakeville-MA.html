We need our faucets and sinks to be working appropriately in order to support safe and hygienic living conditions too.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
