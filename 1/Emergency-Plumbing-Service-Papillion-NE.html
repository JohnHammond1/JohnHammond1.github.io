<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
