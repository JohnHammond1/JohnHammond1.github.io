<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested for many years. Originally, there would have been a hot and cold  water line increasing to the faucet (generally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless specialists can cure in-place whole new areas of pipe within your damaged line, via small and even pre-existing entry points.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most prevalent and destructive water problems: difficult water.  Hard water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Difficult water destroys warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and strengthen into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
