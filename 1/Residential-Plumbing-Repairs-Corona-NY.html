<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
