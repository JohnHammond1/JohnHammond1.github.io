If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog.

Hair-stoppers are quite low-cost and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually triggering a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
