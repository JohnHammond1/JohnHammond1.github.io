If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping.

For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
