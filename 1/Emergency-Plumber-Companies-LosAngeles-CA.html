I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
