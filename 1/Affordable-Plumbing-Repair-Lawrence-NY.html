<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is very important to determine the precise place of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the issue.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
