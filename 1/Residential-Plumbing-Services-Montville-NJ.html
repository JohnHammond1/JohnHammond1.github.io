<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Montville NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
