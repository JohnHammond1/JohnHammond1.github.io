<p>The next step we need to carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>
