<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Utica NY</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was frequently obstructing. They came out and dug a new path for the line linked it to the sewer and everything. It was extremely hot and I truly value their hard work to permit us to use our water facilities once again. Had a terrific experience with these folks. I highly advise their services.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
