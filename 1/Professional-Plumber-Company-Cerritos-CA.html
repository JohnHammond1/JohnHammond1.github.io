You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet.

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Cerritos CA!</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
