<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Hingham MA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
