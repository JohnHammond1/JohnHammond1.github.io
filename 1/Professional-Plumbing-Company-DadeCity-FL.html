<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
