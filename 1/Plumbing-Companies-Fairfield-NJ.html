<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not included a power cable connected. If this holds true, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Make sure to buy a circuitry set with the correct power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>
