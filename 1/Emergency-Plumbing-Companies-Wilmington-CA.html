<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Wilmington CA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these issues.</p>
