<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is replaced, a license and inspection will not be required. This shall not prevent the licensee from obtaining authorizations and inspections for such work if so wanted.</p>
