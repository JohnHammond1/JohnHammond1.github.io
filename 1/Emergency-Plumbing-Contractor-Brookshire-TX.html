<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
