Tough water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the firmness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned).
