When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Faucets serve an useful purpose, and you want one that reaches conveniently into the sink bowl, lessening the splash and spray that originate from a badly placed, or too short, faucet arm.
