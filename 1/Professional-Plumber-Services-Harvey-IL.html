<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did an incredible task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
