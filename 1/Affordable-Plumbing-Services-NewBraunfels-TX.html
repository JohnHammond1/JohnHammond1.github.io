<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in NewBraunfels TX?</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of desired uses around your house.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
