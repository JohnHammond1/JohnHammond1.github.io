<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for watering systems: Residents found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The property owner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his child.</p>
