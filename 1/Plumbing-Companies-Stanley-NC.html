<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Stanley NC</h3>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our skilled plumbers can determine and solve your low water pressure problem. Indications of deterioration or scale buildup on components might indicate past leakages and high pressure. This can lead plumbers to examine if there is a larger problem needing attention. Working with gas is very dangerous, and it is essential to turn off the line to permit a safe repair process.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has required several repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. A good guideline for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as laid out listed below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
