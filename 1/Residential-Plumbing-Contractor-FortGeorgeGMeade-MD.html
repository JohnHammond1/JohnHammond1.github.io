Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.

<p>Improperly installed gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional.

Your hot water heater need to be flushed as soon as a year. It may have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed. That means 8 less inches of hot water, not to point out the truth that your tap water is being heated in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
