<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually warmed as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated if the tap is right away switched off. The heating temperature level is typically pre-set to match your requirements and preferences. Since they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
