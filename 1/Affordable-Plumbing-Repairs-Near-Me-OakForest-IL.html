When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution.
