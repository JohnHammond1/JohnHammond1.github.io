Please have your license number and three-digit inspection code all set. Inspections might be set up up until 8 p.m. for the next day.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy designs with unique functions that do everything but include the salt, you will pay for each additional feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the special feature will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic system, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>

It eliminates the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes good when you add a water softener.</p>
