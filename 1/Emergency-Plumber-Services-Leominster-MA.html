<h3>Plumbing Services Around Leominster MA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
