<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
