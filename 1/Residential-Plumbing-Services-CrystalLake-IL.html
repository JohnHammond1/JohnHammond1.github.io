When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion.

Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released.
