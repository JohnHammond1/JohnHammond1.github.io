<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller design that ran on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
