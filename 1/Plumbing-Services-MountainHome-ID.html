Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
