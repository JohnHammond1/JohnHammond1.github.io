All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to prospective contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is changed, a license and inspection shall not be required.
