We see this a lot on traditional electrical hot water heater, which use a set of electric heating components to warm the tank. Often, among the 2 stress out, resulting in water that's warm but not hot. If this isn't it, we can replace it or detect the true issue.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin spots leak right now and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
