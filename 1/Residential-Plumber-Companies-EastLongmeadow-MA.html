<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
