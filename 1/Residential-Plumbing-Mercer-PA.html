<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Sometimes drain repair needs can be solved reasonably rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain might need to be taken apart, taken a look at, and cleared before being changed. In many cases, a handyman might identify that a replacement part is needed (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to guarantee regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
<p>Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<h3>Tub Replacement in Mercer Pennsylvania</h2>

From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and bathing, to doing kitchen tasks like washing meals, warm water is a necessity.

<p>Like any system in your house, your gas line degrades with age. Scheduling gas pipe repair services is key if your appliances are malfunctioning or there's a spike in your utility costs.

<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually triggering a backup. This added with other debris in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
