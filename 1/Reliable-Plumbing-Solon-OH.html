<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to release and open water to the exterior if either check valve should leak. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
