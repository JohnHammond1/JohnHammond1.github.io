<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion.
