If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
