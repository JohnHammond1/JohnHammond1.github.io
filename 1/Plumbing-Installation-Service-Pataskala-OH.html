<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
