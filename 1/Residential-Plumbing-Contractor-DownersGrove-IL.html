<h3>Leaky Faucets at DownersGrove IL - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>

<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>

For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
