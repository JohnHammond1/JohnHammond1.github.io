<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
