<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Sometimes drain repair requirements can be resolved relatively rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be disassembled, examined, and cleared before being replaced. In some cases, a handyman might identify that a replacement part is needed (like a pvc, reducer, or tailpiece trap) to ensure typical operation for your drain.
