<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not featured a power cord connected. Get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to purchase a circuitry kit with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the wiring harness to the disposer, make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>
<p>Since of unfavorable or decreased pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage occurs when water is drawn or pulled backwards.
