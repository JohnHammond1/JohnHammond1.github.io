<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
