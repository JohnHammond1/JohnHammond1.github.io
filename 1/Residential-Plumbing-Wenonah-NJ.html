<p>Backflow preventers ought to only be fixed when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
