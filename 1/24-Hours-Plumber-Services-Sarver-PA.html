<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The brine option must be blended and saved in the brine tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, fungi and germs likewise form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
