However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen more often than you think! Typically it happens during the night when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
