<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
