<p>Discover the right water softener for you. If you are in a position that you see the indications of a gas line leak, the most important thing to do is to get out of your house as quickly as possible. Collect your family and move them out, then contact us to signal the gas company what has taken place. Next, call your local plumbing expert so they can come, examine the line, and see if repair or replacement is needed.
