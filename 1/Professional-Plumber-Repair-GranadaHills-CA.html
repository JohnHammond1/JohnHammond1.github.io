<p>When selecting the appropriate system security there are numerous considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system.

Fire protection system are designed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary considerably.</p>
