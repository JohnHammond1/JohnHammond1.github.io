<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system supplying the makeup water, backpressure is produced. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then go into the potable water supply. The very best method to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
