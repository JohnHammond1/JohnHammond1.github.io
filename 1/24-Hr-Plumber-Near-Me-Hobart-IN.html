Water gets in the customer facility through a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water utilization for billing functions. Private service pipelines are usually made from lead, type or plastic K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be critical.</p>
<p>Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
