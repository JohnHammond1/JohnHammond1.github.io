If whatever is ready, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the total costs.
