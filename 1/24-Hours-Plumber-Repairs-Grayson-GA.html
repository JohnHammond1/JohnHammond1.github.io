<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
