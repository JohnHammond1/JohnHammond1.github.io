<p>Woodbury, along with many other communities and companies, has found the best method to avoid these spots from taking place is by minimizing the number of times your water softener regenerates. "Restoring" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, many water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium really isn't full.

PG&E typically does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more congested throughout the years.

This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
