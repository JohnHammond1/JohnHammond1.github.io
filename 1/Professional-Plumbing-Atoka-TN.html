<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
