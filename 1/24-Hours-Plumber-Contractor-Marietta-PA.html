When your house starts to approach this age, you must begin getting more regular inspections and maintenance examine your plumbing to ensure you don't have any leaks or damage developing in your home.</p>

This is usually the case when the water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of a whole new system. In some cases a frustrating toilet just requires a minor change and life is back to typical. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>
