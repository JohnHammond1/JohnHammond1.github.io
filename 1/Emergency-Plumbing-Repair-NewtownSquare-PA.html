<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur regularly than you think! Often it happens in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes.

This makes construction projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
