Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
