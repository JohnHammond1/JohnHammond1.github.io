<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Torrance CA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
