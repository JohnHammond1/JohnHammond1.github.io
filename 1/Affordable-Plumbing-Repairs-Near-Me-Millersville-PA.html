Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves.
