<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies MountainTop PA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its performance below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
