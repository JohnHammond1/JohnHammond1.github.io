<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Nesconset NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
