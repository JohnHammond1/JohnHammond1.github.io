<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take duty if it dripped now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
