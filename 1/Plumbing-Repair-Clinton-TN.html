<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work.
