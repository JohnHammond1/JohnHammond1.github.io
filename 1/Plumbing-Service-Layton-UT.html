<p>The drains in the average house get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can gradually build up with time. The drain will slowly slow till it ends up being entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in stores have restricted effectiveness.

<p>When a sink blockages or breakdowns, you can depend on a Sears Handyman to correct the issue. Sears Handyman specialists have strong experience in sink repairs and unclogging sinks. After arriving at your home, a Sears Handyman will assess the issue and determine the best option to fix your sink so it drains correctly and dependably when you need it.</p>
