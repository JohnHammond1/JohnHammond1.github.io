<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Eugene OR</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
