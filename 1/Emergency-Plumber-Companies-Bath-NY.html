<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house.

<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and larger certainly does not suggest much better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller beads that really provide more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to launch sediment, solidity and dirt.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
