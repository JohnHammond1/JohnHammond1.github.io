If your home was built before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your house was constructed decades before that.</p>
