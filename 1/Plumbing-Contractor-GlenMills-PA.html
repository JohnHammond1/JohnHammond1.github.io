<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these aspects, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
