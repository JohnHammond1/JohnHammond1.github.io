<h3>Drain Cleaning in SpringHill Kansas</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the newly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
