<p>Obvious smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or organisation place, offer us a call. That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or producing foul smells.</p>
