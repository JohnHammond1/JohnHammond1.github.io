<h3>Looking For A Plumber In BessemerCity NC</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee proper backflow prevention remains in place to protect our drinking water throughout the watering season.
