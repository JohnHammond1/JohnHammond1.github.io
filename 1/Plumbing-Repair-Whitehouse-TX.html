<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they ought to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
