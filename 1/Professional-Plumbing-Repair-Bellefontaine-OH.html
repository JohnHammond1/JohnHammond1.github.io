<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>This is the timeless question that numerous house owners ask themselves. Is it much better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The response is totally dependent on your special scenario. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a small leak however remains in otherwise excellent condition, we would advise fixing it. However, if the pipe is continuously leaking and needs regular repairs, we would recommend repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never recommend products or services that would not really benefit the customer.</p>

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
