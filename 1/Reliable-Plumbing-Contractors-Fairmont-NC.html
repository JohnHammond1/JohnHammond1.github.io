<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
