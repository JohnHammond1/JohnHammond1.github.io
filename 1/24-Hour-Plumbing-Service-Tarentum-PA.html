<p>Other than water dripping and the occasional creak, your pipes need to not be making any odd sounds, particularly not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a guaranteed indication of a larger problem. Have your pipes checked as soon as possible so you don't end up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>Improperly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the public water supply. This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water main break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
