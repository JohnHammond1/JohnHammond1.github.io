<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers need to be tested annually and after repair, moving, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT). A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Most of the tankless heaters included a manufacturer guarantee ranging from 10 to 15 years. These heaters usually last more than twenty years.</p>
