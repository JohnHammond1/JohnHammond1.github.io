<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outside, ensuring backflow never ever occurs.</p>

Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is avoiding the # 1 Check from closing all the method. This permits pressure to adjust in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
