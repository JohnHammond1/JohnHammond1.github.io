<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners utilize sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
