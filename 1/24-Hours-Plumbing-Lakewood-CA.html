<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and full bathroom renovating at really competitive rates. Switch on the gas and examine connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the photos to ensure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>You want to save water. Older toilets use up to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer models. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets use less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Replacing your toilet with a brand-new design can conserve thousands of gallons of water - reducing your energy expenses and assisting the environment.</p>

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most terrible and widespread water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the life-span of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Tough water ruins hot water devices. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
