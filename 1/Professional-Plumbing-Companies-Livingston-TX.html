<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are extremely crucial to developing a credibility for excellence. One common method for a house's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread significantly if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and infecting the general public water system.</p>

Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
