<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
