<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, in addition to examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
