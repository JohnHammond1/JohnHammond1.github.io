It is useful to apply pressure on the flange from above using a 2nd set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the fastening system below. Make sure the plumber's putty is visibly oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a complete seal has actually formed, eliminate the excess putty with a rag.</p>
