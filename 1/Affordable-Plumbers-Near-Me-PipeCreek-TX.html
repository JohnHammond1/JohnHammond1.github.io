<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health.
