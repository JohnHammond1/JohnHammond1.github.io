<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Image 1. If additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound, water is likely escaping through a broken or rusted overflow tube.

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
