<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will cause decapitation, it may terrify a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
