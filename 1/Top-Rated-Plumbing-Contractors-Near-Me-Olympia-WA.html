<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
