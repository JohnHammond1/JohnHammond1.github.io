<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Mantua OH</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
