<p>When deciding on the appropriate system protection there are a number of considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the threat that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular threat or need. An airplane garage will need a really different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
