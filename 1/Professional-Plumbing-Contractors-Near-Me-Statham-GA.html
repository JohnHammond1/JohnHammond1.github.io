<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
