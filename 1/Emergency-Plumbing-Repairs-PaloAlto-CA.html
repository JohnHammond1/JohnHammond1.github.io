<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in PaloAlto CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
