<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
