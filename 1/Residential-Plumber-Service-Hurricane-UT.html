<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
