<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, but it is likewise extremely uncommon. They were produced so as to give the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device.

<p>Softeners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more severe is incorrect with them.</p>
