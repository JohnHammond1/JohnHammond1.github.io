As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its many designated usages around your home.</p>
