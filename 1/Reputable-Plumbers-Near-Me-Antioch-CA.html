<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted lifespan of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal.
