The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health threat or health risk conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be checked occasionally to guarantee they are operating correctly.
