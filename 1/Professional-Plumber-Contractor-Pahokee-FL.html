<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
