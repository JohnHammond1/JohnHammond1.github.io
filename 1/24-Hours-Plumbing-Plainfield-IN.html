<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
