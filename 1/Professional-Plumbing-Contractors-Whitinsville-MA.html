<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Whitinsville MA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>For RPZ devices, drainage capability will be sized to accommodate both intermittent discharges and a disastrous failure of the relief valve. Refer to manufacturers circulation curves to determine maximum discharge rate based upon supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is greater. Smelling Rotten Eggs: Gas is naturally odorless so the gas company puts an additive in it to make it smell like rotten eggs. This makes it more noticeable in case of a leak.</p>
