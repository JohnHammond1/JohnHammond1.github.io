When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat.
