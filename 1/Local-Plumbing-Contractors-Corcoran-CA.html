<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most common and devastating water problems: tough water.  Tough water damaged the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life-span of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water damages hot water devices. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and strengthen into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Corcoran CA</h3>
<p>Sometimes called an auger, this useful tool can clear blockages that may be stuck even more down the system. You'll have to take apart the drain and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
