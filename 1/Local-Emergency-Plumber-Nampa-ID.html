But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
