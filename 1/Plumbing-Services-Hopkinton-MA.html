<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
