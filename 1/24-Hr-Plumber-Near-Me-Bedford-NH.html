<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work simply as their name implies. They stop long hair from going into and clogging your shower drain.
