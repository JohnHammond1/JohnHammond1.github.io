<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
