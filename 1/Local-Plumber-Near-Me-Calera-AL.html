<p>Typically, there are tank hot water heater that utilize either natural gas or electricity for their fuel. Gas storage tank systems use almost 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electrical variety. However, they cost a bit more than electrical designs. When either temperature or pressure surpasses predetermined levels, they also feature a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens. We supply gas water heater service, as well as electric hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>

While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
