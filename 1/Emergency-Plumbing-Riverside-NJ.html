<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
