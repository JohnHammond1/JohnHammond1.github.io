<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
