<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>All commercial, industrial, domestic, irrigation and fire line services are needed to have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed. Requirements for multi- and single-family homes are examined based upon site hazards. All consumers with an auxiliary supply of water, such as a well or a pond, are also needed to install and maintain backflow prevention assemblies.</p>
