Tankless water heaters get rid of the long wait for heat of the conventional hot water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, break over time. Usually, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too extensive for repair. For example, if the pipes are rusted, continuous leak problems will occur and replacing the pipes is the better choice We will examine your pipes to figure out if repiping is needed.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will lead to decapitation, it might terrify a couple of years off your life.
