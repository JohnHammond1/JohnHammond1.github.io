A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>

There are several faucet designs, so you might not be able to inform what to replace until you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a good time to think about whether you wish to update the faucet with a brand-new design.</p>

When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
