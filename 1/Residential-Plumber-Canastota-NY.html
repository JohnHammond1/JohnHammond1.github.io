<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily caused because of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely split and simply needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>

Flexible gas lines are typically more effective to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and appliance.
