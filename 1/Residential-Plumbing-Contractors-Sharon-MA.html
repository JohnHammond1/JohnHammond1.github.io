<h3>Drain Cleaning in Sharon MA : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
