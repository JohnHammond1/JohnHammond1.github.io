<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Other indications you may need to repipe include rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily suggest repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to determine the very best course of action.</p>
