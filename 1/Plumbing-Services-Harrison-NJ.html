<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Harrison NJ</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both places. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer checked on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, a special kind of black pipe need to be used that is coated with an unique plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily discernible from underground water lines, and likewise because the plastic coating really safeguards the pipe better than a galvanized covering would.</p>
