<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES COMPANIES, we remain Readily available and open to help with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical requirements. The waste disposal unit is one of the most misused devices in the entire house. Few property owners recognize that a disposal is created particularly to handle food residue washed from a plate-- not entire pieces of leftovers! Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and cause a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets so many call requesting garbage disposal repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. The effect resembles drinking water through a straw. Back-siphonage can occur when there is an interruption of water supply due to nearby fire fighting, a break in a water pipe, etc</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
