<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
