<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Dayton OH</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
