A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>In the long run, a gas heater might be a cheaper choice than an electrical, but the initial cost of the installation and the heater can be considerably higher.

Smaller sized households and people might do much better with an electric hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as described in the area listed below.</p>
