<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
