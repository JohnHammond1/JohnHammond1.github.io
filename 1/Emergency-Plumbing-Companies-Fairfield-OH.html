So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into two categories: Plumbers who handle basic repairs (typically in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in redesigning additions and tasks.</p>
