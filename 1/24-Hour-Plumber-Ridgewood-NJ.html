<p>Backflow threatens due to the fact that it can pollute the public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for example, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
