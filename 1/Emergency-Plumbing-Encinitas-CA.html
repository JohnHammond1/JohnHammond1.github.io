<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous intended usages around your house.</p>
