<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service NewHydePark NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
