Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice devices. Difficult water ruins warm water appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
