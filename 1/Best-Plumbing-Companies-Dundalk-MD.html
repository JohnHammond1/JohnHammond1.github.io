<p>Most homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

At American Leak Detection, our competent group of gas leak professionals have substantial training and accreditation to repair and locate gas leakages.</p>
