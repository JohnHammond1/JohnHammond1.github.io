<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>

<p>Because of a concern at the point of installation or since of maintenance, water softeners leaks are mainly triggered. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely cracked and simply needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
