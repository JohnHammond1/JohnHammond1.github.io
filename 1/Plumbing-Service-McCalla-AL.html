More recent systems use computerized sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just regrow when required. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
