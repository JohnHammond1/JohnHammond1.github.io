If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and rust.
