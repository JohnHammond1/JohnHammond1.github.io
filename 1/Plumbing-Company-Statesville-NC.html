<p>Concealed water leakages are often difficult and have Potentially Major Consequences. Replacing your flapper may need slightly various actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
