You might be wasting money with every flush if your toilet was manufactured before 1994. Older toilets consume to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern-day standard.

It is most likely that your dip tube is broken if you find that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Picture 1. Water is most likely escaping through a broken or rusted overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound. Because case, you have to separate the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
