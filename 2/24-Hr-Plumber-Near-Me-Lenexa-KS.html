Most high-pressure water jetters will run with up to 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>

I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
