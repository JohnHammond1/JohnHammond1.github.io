<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close.

<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Often times basic repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to take a look at your scenario and inform you what needs to be done, however if you employ them, that charge will be deducted from the bill. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and detect the problem. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
