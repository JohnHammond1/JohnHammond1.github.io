<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Columbus IN</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>2 designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
