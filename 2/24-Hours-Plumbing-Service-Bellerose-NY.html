<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of decreased pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never takes place.</p>
