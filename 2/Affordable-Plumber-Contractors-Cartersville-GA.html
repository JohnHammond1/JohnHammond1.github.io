<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller sized model that ran on the exact same principle however might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
