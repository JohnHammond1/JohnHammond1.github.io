<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the exterior if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
