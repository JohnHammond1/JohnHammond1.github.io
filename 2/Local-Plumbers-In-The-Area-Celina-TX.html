Reattach the gas tank to the Weed Eater trimmer with the Torx screws that held it in location originally. Reattach the fuel lines to the carburetor in the same positions as they were initially placed. Reconnect the spark plug wire. A gas line will first need to be ranged from the street to the house, a meter set up, followed by gas lines set up inside the home from the meter to the brand-new home appliances.
