<p>Backflow preventers are important for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you pick, all water softeners need to be properly kept. The brine option must be mixed and stored in the brine tank. Routine obstructing of the resin also requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, normal backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Likewise, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, check out the maker's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen.

Efficiency is key, and you will save cash when you are only using what you need instead of unnecessarily losing excess gas due to leaks.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device allows water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong method.
