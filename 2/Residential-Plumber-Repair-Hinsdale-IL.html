<p>The Battelle Study also found tough water to rapidly result in clogged shower heads, in some cases after as little as a year and a half of regular usage. After just one week of continuous testing with hard water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to laboratory results. Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, on the other hand, carried out nearly as well as on the day they were installed.</p>
<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is avoiding the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This enables pressure to adjust between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
