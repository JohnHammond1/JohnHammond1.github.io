<p>When deciding on the proper system security there are several considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world.

The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to fulfill that specific danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
