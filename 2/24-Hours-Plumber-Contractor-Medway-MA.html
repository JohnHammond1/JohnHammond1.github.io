To avoid corrosion from rust, tank are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in destructive materials. By having the anode rod checked routinely and replaced as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Leaks can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Due to the fact that the tank or the entire toilet should be raised off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leakages can be difficult to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
