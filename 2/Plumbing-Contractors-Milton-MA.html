<h3>Bathtub Faucet Replacement in Milton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned up main drain.

<p>Bill was my technician and he showed up within an hour of my call to Clog Dawg. Bill was good, knowledgeable, and clearly experienced.

I felt great that Costs had actually seen all the important things that might have failed with my repair and he might deal with them.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
