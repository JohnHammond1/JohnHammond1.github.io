<p>Sometimes, our service technicians will suggest that you replace your hot water heater instead of buy repairs.

That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>

<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Salem WV</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
