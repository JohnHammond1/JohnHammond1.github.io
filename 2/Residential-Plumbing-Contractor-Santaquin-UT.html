Recurring repairs and leaks.

As an outcome, we recommend changing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>

Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer properties are needed to have them. If you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or organisation, Doug's can help you find and recognize them. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
