<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more considerable costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you money and time as well as safeguard your health in the future. After softening a big amount of difficult water, the exchange medium becomes layered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium need to be charged or regenerated (Figure 1)when this happens.
