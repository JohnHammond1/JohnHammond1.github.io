I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 โฒ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
