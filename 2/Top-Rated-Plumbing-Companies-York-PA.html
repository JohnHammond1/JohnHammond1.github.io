That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust.
