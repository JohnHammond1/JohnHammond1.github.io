<p>Borax beings in the specific very same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it includes the exact same downsides i.e. skin irritation and build-up. If either of these disadvantages are inappropriate to you - you'll want to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Switch on the water to fill the toilet tank.
