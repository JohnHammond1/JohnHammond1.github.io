It will make your clothes whiter and brighter, and of course, it makes cleaning a breeze. You remove areas, streaks and residue on components and showers also, and one of the very best parts is that you have spot-free dishes and silverware.</p>
<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen.
