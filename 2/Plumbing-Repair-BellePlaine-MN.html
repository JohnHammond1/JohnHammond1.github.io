<p>To make placing a toilet easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That means you have to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
