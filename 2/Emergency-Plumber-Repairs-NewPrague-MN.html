Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be evaluated occasionally to ensure they are working effectively.
