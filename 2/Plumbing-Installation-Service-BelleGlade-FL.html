It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly.
