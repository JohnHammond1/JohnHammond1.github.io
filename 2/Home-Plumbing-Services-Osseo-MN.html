<p>Gas lines included external covers that are primarily made of plastic. Remove them to expose the gas pipes beneath. Place on a gas mask given that breathing in such gases is risky for your respiratory system. Make certain to use gloves too. Electric water heaters also heat water inside a storage tank for distribution throughout your house. In this case, 2 electrical heating components controlled by individual thermostats are accountable for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. In some cases it might be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be used according to maker instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
