<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord attached. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to buy a circuitry package with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
