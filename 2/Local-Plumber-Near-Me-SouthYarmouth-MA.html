<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system.

Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
