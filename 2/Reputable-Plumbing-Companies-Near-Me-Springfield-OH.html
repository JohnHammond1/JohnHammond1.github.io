<p>A lot of cars and trucks have a metal line that runs the length of the cars and truck with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Repairing a leaking fuel line is a basic task for a repair facility and expenses in between $60 and $120. Lavacot says it can easily be done at home by the semi-advanced mechanic. Difficult water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these symptoms.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
