<p>Many toilets used today operate with a basic gravity flushing design, suggesting they use the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in a growing number of homes. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to draw the water into the bowl and down into the sewers. A disadvantage of this device is that it's much more hard to unclog your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
