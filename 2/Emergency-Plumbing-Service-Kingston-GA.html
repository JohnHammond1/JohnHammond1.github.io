<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

<p>As described earlier in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
