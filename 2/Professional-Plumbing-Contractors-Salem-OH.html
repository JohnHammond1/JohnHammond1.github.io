The factors for this can range from leaks, faulty or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements may be enough if it is one of the mentioned problems. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems happening often, then a water heater replacement is essential.</p>
