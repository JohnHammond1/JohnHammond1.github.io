When water is heated up, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a possibility to end up being coated within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
