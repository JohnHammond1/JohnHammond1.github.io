Have your pipes examined as quickly as possible so you do not end up with a major leak.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit are a necessary feature in any modern kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be persistent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain.

Then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in several drains at once in your house. This can happen in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup.
