<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal can lower a house's overall garbage output by crushing most common food scraps so they can be removed through the sink as wastewater. A garbage disposal fits virtually perfectly into the sink, and can be kept by simply dealing with a few ice and some sodium bicarbonate once a month to sharpen the blades and minimize undesirable odors.</p>
