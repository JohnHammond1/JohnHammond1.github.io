This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This truly depends on what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old unit is to remove. In most cases, elimination will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the total expenses, however in some cases the expenses could be greater if extra pipes must likewise be replaced.</p>
