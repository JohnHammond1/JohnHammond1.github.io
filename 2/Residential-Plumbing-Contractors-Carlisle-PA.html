You can remove it safely with needle-nose pliers if you see a blockage.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the new one at the very same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This truly depends on what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old unit is to remove. In most cases, elimination will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the total expenses, however in some cases the expenses could be greater if extra pipes must likewise be replaced.</p>
<p>We offer service for both commercial and residential clients. Call 804-358-1616.

You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
