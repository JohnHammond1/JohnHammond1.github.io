Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, free" sodium ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
