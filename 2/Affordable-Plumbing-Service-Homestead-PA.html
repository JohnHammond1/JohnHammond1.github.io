<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include device wires connected, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and connect the wires according the manufacturer's directions if yours doesn't. The majority of standard disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're finished.</p>
<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and simple. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most common washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
