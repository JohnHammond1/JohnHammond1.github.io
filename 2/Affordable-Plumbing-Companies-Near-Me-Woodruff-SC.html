<p>Both methods are extremely effective and decreasing waste and clearing it. The greatest difference remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the system, cover it, then turn it on. If it's entirely complete, it will take a little while to clear through the waste, and if you find you forgot something, you need to wait up until it's done to put the brand-new waste in.</p>
