<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RPBA works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or non-health risks.</p>
