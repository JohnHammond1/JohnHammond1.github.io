<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
