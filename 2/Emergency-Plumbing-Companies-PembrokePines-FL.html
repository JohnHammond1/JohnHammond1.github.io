<p>Noise is normal, however when you discover that the sounds are all there but food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has actually gone. Some sounds suggest the need for repairs or a good clear out, and you can provide the system a good check before beginning to price brand-new ones. But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for extremely little future usage.</p>

That's a quality business. . Setting up a garbage disposal is a reasonably simple job for a knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer. Grab a couple of fundamental tools and follow our how-to.</p>
