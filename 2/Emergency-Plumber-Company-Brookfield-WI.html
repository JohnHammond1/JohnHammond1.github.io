This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>

<p>Other indications you may need to repipe consist of rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the problem to determine the best course of action.</p>
