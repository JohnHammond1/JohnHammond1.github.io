This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
