<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
