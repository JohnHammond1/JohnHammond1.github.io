Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
