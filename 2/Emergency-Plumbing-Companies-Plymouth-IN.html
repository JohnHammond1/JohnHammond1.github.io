<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
