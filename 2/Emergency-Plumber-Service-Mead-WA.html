<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
