Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection.

<p>You live in an older house. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
