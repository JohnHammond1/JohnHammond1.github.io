<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
