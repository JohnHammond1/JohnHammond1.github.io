If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these annoyances. However, read the producer's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
