A license is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line.
