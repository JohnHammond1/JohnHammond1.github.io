After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
