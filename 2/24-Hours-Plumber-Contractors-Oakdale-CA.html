<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
