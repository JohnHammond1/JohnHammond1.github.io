<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming a problem in your water supply by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>
