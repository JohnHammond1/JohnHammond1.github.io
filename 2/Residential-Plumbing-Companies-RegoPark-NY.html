This can occur at any time, such as during a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>

Not only can dirty pipes trigger your water to drain slowly, but it can likewise cause pipes to burst and septic tank back-ups. Ensure you don't have a plumbing catastrophe and make certain your pipes are clean. 1. Get rid of the garbage disposer and disconnect all the old traps and drain lines from below the sink.</p>
