<h3>Water Heater Repair & Replacement in EastLansing Michigan</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>New homes built with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
