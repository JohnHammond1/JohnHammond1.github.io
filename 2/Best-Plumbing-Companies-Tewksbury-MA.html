<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not included a power cord attached. If this is the case, get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Make sure to acquire a circuitry package with the correct power rating and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable when you link the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
