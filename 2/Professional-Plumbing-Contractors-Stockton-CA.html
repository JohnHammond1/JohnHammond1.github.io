<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
