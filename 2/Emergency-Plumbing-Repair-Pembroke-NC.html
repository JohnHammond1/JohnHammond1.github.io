<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some water heaters promote functions that minimize mineral scale accumulation by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Features such as these add cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best technique is to get the water heater with the 12 year guarantee. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot. A popular replacement material for metal pipes, CPVC pipe is stiff plastic piping that has thick walls and can be used for cold and hot drinking water pipes. CPVC is simple to install and fulfills the most strenuous building regulations.</p>
<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your unit.
