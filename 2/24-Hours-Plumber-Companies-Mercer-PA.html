If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can trigger water to develop all the way up your drains and develop a leak someplace along the method.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
