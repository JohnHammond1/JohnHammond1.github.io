<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Centre AL</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work.

<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
