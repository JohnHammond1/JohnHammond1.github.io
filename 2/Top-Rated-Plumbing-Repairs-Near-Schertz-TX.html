This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
