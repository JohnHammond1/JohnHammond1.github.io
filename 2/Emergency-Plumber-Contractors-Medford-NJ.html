Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
