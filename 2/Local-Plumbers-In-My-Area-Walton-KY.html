<p>As discussed previously in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and totally odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the proper places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are generally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the right side of one of the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, rotate the installing ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal.

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is known as fouling. Often it may be essential to filter the water prior to it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be used according to maker instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
