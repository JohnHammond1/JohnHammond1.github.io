Contamination may happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can occur through a procedure called backflow.</p>

In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or damp lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
