<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released.
