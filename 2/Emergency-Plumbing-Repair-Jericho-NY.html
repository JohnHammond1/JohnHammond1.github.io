<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high danger of entering contact with contaminants due to backflows. Lots of faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout.

Adding air in this method preserves consistent water pressure, which causes the component to utilize less water.</p>
