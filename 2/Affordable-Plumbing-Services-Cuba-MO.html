Each state has its own rules and guidelines when getting a contractor's license, see this post for more in-depth details.</p>
<p>There are several indications to watch out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and fixtures in your home have been shut off. 3) The hot water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to higher gas and water bills, often extremely rapidly.</p>
