<p>Surprise water leakages are typically demanding and have Possibly Serious Effects. Changing your flapper may require a little different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
