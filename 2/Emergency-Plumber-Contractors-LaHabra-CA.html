<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
