<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a system, sub-system, or component  group is replaced, a license and inspection will not be needed. If so wanted, this shall not prevent the licensee from getting authorizations and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections relating to the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a personal water system into the general public water system. This can occur at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
