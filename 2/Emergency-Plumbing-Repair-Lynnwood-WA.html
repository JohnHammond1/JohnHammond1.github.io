<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
