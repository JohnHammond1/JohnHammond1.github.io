<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
