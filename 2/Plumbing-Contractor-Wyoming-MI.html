<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. In some cases it might be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
