<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
