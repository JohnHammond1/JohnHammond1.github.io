<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain NotreDame IN</h3>
<p>Root Intrusion: Root intrusion refers to what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which may result in substantial home damage. Keep an eye out for damp, green patches in your yard, a relentless sewage odor in or around your home, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical signs of root intrusion.</p>
<p>All equipment or systems provided by drinkable water lines that may go through contamination should have airgaps (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( b )).
