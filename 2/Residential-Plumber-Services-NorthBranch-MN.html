<p>After arriving after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they would not take obligation if it leaked now due to the fact that of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing.
