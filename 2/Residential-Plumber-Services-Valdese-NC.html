<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered since of an issue at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely split and just needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
