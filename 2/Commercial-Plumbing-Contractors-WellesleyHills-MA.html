A lot of houses in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
