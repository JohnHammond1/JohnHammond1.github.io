Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire house when you identify a leak.</p>
