<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the new one at the same hourly rate. This can increase the quantity of time required to install the brand-new unit, for that reason increasing expenses. This actually depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old unit is to eliminate.
