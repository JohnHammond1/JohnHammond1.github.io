<p>New England Pipe Remediation is the premier sewer repair supplier in the Northeast. While this may seem like a problem with your faucet, it's usually caused by something else - like a plumbing issue or problem with your water heater. More and more people are trading in their old water heaters for brand-new, tankless variations. Whether you're seeking to increase your house's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of running out of warm water, a tankless water heater could be the perfect service for you.</p>
<p>As pipes age, the more likely they are to burst and rust. This is just enhanced depending upon the product of the pipes used in your house. If you live in a structure that is around 50 years old, there is a good chance that your pipes were made with galvanized metal which is more likely to burst as it ages. When your home begins to approach this age, you ought to begin getting more regular inspections and maintenance checks on your plumbing to make sure you don't have any leaks or damage developing in your house.</p>

<p>A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street.

<p>If you  want to remove the salt, merely fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is expensive: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that utilizes high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will run with as much as 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
