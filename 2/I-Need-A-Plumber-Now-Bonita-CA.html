The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to link to the main gas supply, which normally averages 30'.</p>
<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the normal direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need.
