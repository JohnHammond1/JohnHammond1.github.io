<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Burlington MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
<p>There are several signs to watch out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm or even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and fixtures in your house have been switched off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water costs, sometimes very quickly.</p>
