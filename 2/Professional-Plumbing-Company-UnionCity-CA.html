<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service UnionCity CA</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Given that the solidity minerals have a greater favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
