<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Shepherdstown WV</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
