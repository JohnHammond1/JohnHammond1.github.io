The brine option must be mixed and stored in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin also requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Similarly, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency.

<p>The easiest method to keep you and your family safe from the possible hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at the same time in your house, then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in multiple places and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as many plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
