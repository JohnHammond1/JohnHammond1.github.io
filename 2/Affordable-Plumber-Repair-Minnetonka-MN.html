Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance before devoting to a price, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are especially susceptible to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to become coated within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
