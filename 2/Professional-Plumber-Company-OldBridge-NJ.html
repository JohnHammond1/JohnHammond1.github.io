<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners offer nowadays. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Company then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was constructed before the 1970s or hasn't been remodeled, you will more than likely have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
