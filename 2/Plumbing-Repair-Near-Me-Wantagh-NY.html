As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
