<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
