Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
