<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
