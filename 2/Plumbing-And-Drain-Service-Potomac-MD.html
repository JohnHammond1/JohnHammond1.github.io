When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle.
