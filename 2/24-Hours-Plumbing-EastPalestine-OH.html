For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>When they have to match local water and sewer capacities, Garbage disposal units may cost more. The plumbing in the house should work well or backup can take place, and septic tanks may need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
