<p>In most cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than changed, since the issue typically comes down to a single element or two. Sometimes, nevertheless, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is just a more practical option. This normally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, widespread rust over numerous components, or simply since you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed.

A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
