The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, changed.

The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
