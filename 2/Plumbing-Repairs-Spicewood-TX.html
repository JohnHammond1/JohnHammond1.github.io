<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
