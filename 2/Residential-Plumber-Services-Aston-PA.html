<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
