<p>We truly appreciate our customers and the services that we offer. As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, totally free" sodium ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of firmness.</p>
<p>Energy Performance. Choosing a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is suggested. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more efficient the water heater the greater the EF ranking.
