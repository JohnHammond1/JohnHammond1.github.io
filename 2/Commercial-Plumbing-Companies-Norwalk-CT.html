<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just difficult to detect, they're also efficient in triggering some severe damage. Pinhole leaks, for example, are so small that they just release a number of droplets at a time. That's far too small to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up throughout the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future.</p>
