<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
