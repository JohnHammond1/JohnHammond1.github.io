<p>Handheld sprayer. Leakages can sometimes establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet beneath.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of security. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way. There are 2 various types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.
