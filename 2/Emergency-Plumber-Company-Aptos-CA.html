<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
