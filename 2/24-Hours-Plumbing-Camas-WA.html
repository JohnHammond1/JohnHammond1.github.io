Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
