<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this article about liners. I find that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no clue on what they are stating.

Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
