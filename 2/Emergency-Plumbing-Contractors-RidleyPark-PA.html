Grease: Never put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than washing away, these products often harden to form nasty blockages, which you might need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet simpler, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you have to cut off the extending ends later with a hacksaw. However very first link the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and look for leaks. If you find any problems, leaving the bolts uncut till you have actually done these final checks lets you quickly get rid of and reset the toilet.</p>

<p>In some cases, our service technicians will recommend that you replace your hot water heater rather than invest in repairs. This is generally the case when the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new system. Sometimes a problematic toilet simply needs a minor adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>
