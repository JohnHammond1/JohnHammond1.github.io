If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
