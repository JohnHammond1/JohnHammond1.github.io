<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
