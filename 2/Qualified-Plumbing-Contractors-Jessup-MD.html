<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never want to see this company once again.</p>
