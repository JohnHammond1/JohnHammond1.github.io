<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market.
