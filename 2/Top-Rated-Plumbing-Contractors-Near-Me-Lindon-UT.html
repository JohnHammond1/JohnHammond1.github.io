<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
