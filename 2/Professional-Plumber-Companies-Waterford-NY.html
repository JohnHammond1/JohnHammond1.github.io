<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Waterford NY</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. This kind of camera is especially useful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system.</p>
<p>Extremely typically the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply place a long, tough, wood handle (a broom handle will suffice) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force lowering, rotate clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be essential to reset the disposal. Find the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. If the clog continues, use any kind of drain cleaner to free it.</p>
