<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water requires. Your EcoWater Pro will check your water to determine the best water treatment for your house.

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
