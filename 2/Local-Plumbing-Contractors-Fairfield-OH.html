<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
