<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Longs SC</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
