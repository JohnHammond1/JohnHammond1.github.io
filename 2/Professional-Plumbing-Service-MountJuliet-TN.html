The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a cooking water connection that might be used to supply a lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's wise to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
