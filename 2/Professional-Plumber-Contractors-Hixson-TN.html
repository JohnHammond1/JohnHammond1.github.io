<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous factors that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
