<p>Supplying quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products including severe chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the simplest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least pricey, but likewise the least reliable choice.

Sprinkler Warehouse does not advise AVB's for waterings systems where there is a potential to contaminate drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to discover when one has stopped working.</p>
