<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
