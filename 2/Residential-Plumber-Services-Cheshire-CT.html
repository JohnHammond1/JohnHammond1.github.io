<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
