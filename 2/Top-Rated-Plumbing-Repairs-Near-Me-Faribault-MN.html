<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Faribault MN</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their duties break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (often in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who concentrate on remodeling projects and additions.</p>
<p>Call your local Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing at (855) 982-2028 for safe and reliable water heater installation. A lot of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are offered. However they're harder to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
