You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
