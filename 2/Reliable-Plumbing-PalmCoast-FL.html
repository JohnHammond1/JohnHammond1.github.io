<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord connected. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Be sure to purchase a wiring set with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
