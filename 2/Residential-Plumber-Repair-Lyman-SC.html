<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Lyman SC</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of defense. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically defined-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention however do not get hung up on them. I mention them just because they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
