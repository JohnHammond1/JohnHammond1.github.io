<p>Due to the fact that you have to move quickly in the face of a gas leak, having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is vital. Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has actually service technicians thoroughly trained to find the place of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the seriousness of the leak. Before employing any professional, make certain to ask for free estimates on just how much it will cost to fix your plumbing problems.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
