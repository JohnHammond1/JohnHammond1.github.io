Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance before dedicating to a price, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
