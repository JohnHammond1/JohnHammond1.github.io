If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is created to release and open water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience obstructions in multiple drains simultaneously in your home, then that normally means that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in several locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup.

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
