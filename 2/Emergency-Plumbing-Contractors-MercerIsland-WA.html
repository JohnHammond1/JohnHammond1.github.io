<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Often times simple repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a fixed price of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a charge to take a look at your circumstance and inform you what needs to be done, but if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the costs. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and identify the issue. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
