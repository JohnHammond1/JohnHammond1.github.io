<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or fixture  group is replaced, a license and inspection shall not be needed.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>

Repeat the process of sealing the leakages till you are satisfied that there are no more gas leakages if there are any leaks.
