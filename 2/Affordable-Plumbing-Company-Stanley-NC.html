<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Stanley NC</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think! When you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
