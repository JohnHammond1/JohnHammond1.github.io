Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
