<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Alameda CA</h3>
<p>Contact your local licensed RainSoft dealer today for more information about the benefits of buying a water softening system for your home. In addition to our EC4 model, you can also ask about our TC series water softeners, which supply likewise outstanding water softening benefits without the automated microprocessor controls of the EC4 system.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
