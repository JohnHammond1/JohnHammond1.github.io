<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease accumulation, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a number of methods homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, consisting of using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using an option of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance company, realtor or city inspector.</p>
