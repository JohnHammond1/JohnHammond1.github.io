<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between guy and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jiggle and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making certain your trip lever is working well can conserve you the trouble of those small everyday troubles - that the majority of people just deal with and never ever recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a bad seal.</p>
