<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, in addition to inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
