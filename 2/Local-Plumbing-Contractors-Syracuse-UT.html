Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
