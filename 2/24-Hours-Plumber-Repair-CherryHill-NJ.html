When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-term option.</p>

Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
