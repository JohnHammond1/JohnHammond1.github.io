<p>Concealed water leaks are typically demanding and have Potentially Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need a little different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit.
