More extreme cross-connection dangers might need a special type of backflow preventer that can automatically release potentially contaminated water before it goes into the public water supply.

Offered in numerous colors.</p>
<p>Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to become covered within, New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
