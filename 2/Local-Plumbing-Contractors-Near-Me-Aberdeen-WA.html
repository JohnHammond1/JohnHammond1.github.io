<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
