Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
