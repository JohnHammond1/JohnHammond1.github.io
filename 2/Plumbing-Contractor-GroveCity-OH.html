Backflow into a public water system can pollute the water or contaminate because system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system unusable or unsafe to drink), and each water supplier has a duty to supply water that is usable and safe to drink under all foreseeable circumstances. Moreover, customers generally have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water supply is always safe to consume. For these reasons, your water district should take precautions to protect its public water system against backflow.</p>
