Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.

The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
