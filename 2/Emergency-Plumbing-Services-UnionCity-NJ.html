<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a division of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for checking work performed by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to ensure conformity with the plumbing and gas code. Bill 41-15 (PDF): The Existing Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was authorized by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015. This code adopted the PHCC National Requirement Plumbing Code - Illustrated, 2015 edition, the NFPA 54 National Fuel Gas Code, 2015 edition and the NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, 2014 edition.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life expectancy of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a hardening lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
