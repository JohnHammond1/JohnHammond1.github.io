<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
