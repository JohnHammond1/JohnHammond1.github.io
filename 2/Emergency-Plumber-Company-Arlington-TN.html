<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions. As tough water passes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Considering that the solidity minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their place.</p>

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the building envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a fixture, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection shall not be needed. This shall not prevent the licensee from obtaining permits and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>Backpressure might happen when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly secured.</p>
<p>Gas lines are crucial for families: they power stoves, water heaters, and other home appliances to keep you dry, warm, and comfortable all year long. However, your gas line also carries naturally unpredictable elements that can be dangerous if not handled properly. Time and use corrode gas lines, making them more vulnerable to breaks and cracks. At American Leak Detection, our knowledgeable group of gas leak experts have extensive training and certification to locate and repair gas leaks.</p>
