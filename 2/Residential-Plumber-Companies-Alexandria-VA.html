<p>In general, toilets are pretty simple to repair and run. Nearly any part can be removed and changed fairly easily and quickly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Harmed toilets can do some truly extensive, pricey, and ... smelly damage to a house.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
