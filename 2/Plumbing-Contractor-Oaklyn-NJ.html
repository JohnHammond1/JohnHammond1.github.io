<p>Since presenting a mechanical pipe repair products over 100 years back, Cabinet has broadened its repair product line to include clamps and weldable sleeves for the energy market. If your toilet was made before 1994, you could be squandering money with every flush. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern requirement. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is used to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm quicker. If you find that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob, it is likely that your dip tube is broken.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are safe, but gradually they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
