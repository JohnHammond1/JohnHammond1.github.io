<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Stratford NJ</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
