When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

The only problem is that potassium chloride is pricey: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag.
