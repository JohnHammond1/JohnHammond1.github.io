<p>Get rid of scratchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models connect to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals.

In some cases it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
