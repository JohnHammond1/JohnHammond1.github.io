<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately kept. The salt water solution should be combined and saved in the salt water tank. Routine blocking of the resin also requires special attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Similarly, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's instructions before adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
