<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
