<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
