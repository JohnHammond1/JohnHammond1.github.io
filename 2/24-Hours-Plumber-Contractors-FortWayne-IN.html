<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, preventing polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow range from the fairly easy to the complicated and extremely advanced.</p>
