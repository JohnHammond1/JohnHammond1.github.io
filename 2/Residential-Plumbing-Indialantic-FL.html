This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
