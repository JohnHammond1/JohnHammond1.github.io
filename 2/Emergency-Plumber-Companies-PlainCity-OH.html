<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
