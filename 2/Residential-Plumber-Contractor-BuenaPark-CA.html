<h3>How To Overcome Emergency Plumbing Issues BuenaPark CA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
