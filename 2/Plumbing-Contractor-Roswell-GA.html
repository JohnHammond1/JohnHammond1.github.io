Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a fixture, sub-system, or system group is replaced, a permit and inspection shall not be required.

In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching job rather of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the same material and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you find a leak.</p>
