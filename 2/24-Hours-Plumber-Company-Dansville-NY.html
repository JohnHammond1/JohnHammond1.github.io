<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>All devices or systems supplied by potable water lines that might go through contamination needs to have airgaps (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( b )).
