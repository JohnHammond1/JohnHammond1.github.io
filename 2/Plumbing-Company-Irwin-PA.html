That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is changed, an authorization and inspection will not be required.
