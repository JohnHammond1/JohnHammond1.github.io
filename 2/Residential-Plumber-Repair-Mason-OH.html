Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
