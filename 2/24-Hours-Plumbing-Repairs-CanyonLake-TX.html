<p>We truly care about our consumers and the services that we supply. As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to remove solidity.</p>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are typically blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black).

Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
