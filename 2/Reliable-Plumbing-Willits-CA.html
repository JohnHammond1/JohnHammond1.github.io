<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you may need to take into consideration when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost.
