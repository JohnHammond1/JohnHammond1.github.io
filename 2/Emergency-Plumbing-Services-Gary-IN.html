<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they don't get in the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might allow tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices are subject to testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they undergo periodic tests later on, too.</p>
