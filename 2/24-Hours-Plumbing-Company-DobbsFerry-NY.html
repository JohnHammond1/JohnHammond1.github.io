<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in DobbsFerry NY?</h3>
<p>Aside from water trickling and the periodic creak, your pipes must not be making any odd sounds, especially not ones loud enough to keep you up in the evening. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a proven sign of a larger problem. Have your pipes inspected as soon as possible so you do not wind up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the prospective risks of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the very first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Most of the times, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and remove the particles. Depending on the intensity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger may be needed. Parker & Sons Plumbing values the safety and security of all of our customers, so our plumbers are all highly-trained and insured to guarantee you receive safe and quality service.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
