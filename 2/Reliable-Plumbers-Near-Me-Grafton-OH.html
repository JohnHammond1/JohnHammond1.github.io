<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>To remove the cable from the old disposer, use a screwdriver to remove the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons offers annual examinations on your sewer and septic systems. Our professionals thoroughly examine your whole drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to avoid future problems before they take place. Our yearly maintenance services likewise include extensive drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
