<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
