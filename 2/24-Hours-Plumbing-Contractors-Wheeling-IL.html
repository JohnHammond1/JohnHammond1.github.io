Backflow into a public water system can pollute or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to consume), and each water provider has an obligation to offer water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable situations. In addition, customers normally have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water system is always safe to consume. For these factors, your water district must take precautions to protect its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
