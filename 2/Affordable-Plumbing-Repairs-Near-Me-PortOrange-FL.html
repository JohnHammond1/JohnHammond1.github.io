<p>The repair professional should be able to identify the lots of different makers and the particular designs produced throughout the years. Some models might seem similar on the outside but could need various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician must be able to determine the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Sometimes the identification number of the assembly will be required to distinguish one model from another. It is important to understand the right model to guarantee you get the proper repair parts.</p>

However, debris in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the method.
