Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will trigger the foundation to move and establish cracks. In this case, you'll need expert plumbers along with foundation repair professionals.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
