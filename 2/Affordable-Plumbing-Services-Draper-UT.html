<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers must be evaluated each year and after repair, relocation, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT). A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham. The majority of the tankless heaters come with a producer guarantee ranging from 10 to 15 years.
