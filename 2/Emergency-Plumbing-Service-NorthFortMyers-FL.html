A stop work order shall specify the factor for its issuance and the conditions which must be satisfied before work will be allowed to resume.</p>
<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
