Scale develops in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices.

<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the possible dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience obstructions in several drains at the same time in your home, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple places and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
