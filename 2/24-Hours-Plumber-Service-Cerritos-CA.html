<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
