<p>Noticeable smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your home or service location, offer us a call. That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair right away.

<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>

After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's good to choose you.</p>
