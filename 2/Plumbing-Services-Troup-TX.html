<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion.

Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched.
