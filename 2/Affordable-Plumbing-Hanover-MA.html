<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Hanover MA</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of designated uses around your home.</p>
