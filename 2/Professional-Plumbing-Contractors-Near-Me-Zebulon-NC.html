<p>The majority of residential houses have roof gutters that flow into downspout drains that direct water far from your home. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to local storm drains or street gutters, they often become clogged with tree roots and particles.

Please note that Roto-Rooter does unclean roof gutters or rectangular aluminum seamless gutter downspouts.</p>
<p>If you have a dishwasher that the system connects to, then this is the next part to detach. The only thing left after this is to detach it from the sink drain.
